The following advancements are in progress and have started to be finalized, but on the problem part, I am still looking for ways to get more accurate results at this point. 

| Stage              | Progress   | Date to Accomplish | Description                                                                                                                        | Problem                                                                                                                               |

| Sprint 1 Review    | Completed  | March 27            | Reviewing progress after Sprint 1                                                                                                  | Difficulty in preparing complex data with tools and ensuring data suitability through visualization and validation with VESTA, Existence of multidimensional data requiring preprocessing |

| Testing Stage      | Completed  | May 1               | Initiating/further testing                                                                                                         | Doping with Al, Cu, Mo, and W in TiO2 improves the DOS phonon graph because they affect the structure and interactions in the TiO2 crystal, causing an increase in phonon energy at some energy points. This indicates a significant change in the vibrational properties of TiO2 that is potentially important in technological applications. Vacancy in the FeS material does not show a significant change in the graph, the vacancy result of 8% with perfect material still produces the same prediction, it needs to be reviewed |
| Sprint 2 Review    | Completed | April 24            | Reviewing progress after Sprint 2                                                                                                  | Completing material data by performing vacancy on FeS2 for result material                                                                                                                                 |

| Sprint 3 Review    |In progress | May 22              | Reviewing progress after Sprint 3                                                                                                  | Vacancy is done with a percentage below 10% by removing 1 Fe atom or 1 S atom in FeS2. Orthorhombic phonon distribution results still produce the same predictions and phonon peaks, but the accuracy increases. If this FeS2 shows the vacancy value in the material affects the prediction results, then the analysis will continue to find out the vacancy analysis in materials with unit cells above 1x1x1.                                                                                                                                 |
